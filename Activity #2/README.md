This program is a simple Java application that demonstrates the use of classes and objects. The Book class is used to create book objects containing information such as the title, author, publication date, and current page. It also includes methods to display book details, update the current page, and change the author.

In the MyBookList class, several Book objects are created and displayed. Some of the book details are modified, such as updating the current page and the author. The program then stores all the book objects in an array and checks which books were published after the year 2010.

This program helps students understand fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including object creation, method usage, and working with arrays and conditional statements.
