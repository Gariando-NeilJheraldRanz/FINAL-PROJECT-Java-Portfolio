This Java program demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including inheritance, classes, objects, and arrays. The Person class acts as the parent class and contains common attributes such as name, age, and gender. The Student and Teacher classes inherit from the Person class, allowing them to reuse these shared attributes.

The Student class introduces an additional attribute for a student ID, while the Teacher class includes a department and a list of courses handled. The Course class represents a subject with a course code and course name. In the main program, objects of the student, teacher, and course classes are created, and their details are displayed.

This program helps students understand how inheritance works and how different classes interact with each other within a simple school system example.
