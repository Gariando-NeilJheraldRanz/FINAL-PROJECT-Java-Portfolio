This Java program implements a simple library management system that allows users to interact through a menu-driven interface. It uses arrays to store book titles along with their availability status. The library can store a maximum of five books.

Users can choose to add new books, update a book’s status (Available or Borrowed), or view all books currently stored in the library. The program runs in a loop, repeatedly displaying the menu until the user chooses to exit.

This program helps students practice fundamental Java concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, and handling user input using the Scanner class.
